ow_power_system
===============
It creates a node called power_system_node, which listens for power consumption
in a topic called power_draw, publishes the estimated state of charge (SOC)
in a topic called state_of_charge, and published the estimated remaining useful life (RUL) in seconds. 

Currently, the state_of_charge topic publishes the next voltage and RUL value in a csv generated by the battery model every one second or ten seconds, depending on the power draw csv used.

The SOC value will fluctuate realistically, but the RUL value currently outputs an uncharacteristically accurate value. This is due to issues with data formatting, so please be aware that RUL would ordinarily fluctuate, with the predicted value becoming more accurate closer to EOD (end of discharge).

Once the publisher hits the end of the csv, it continues to publish the final voltage value indefinitely.

This node can be launched using the format:
`<node name="power_system_node" pkg="ow_power_system" type="power_system_node" args=""/>`

There are three options for power draw levels: 1W (low power consumption), 8W (moderate power consumption), and 16W (high power consumption, intended to indicate a fault). To select which to use, the csv_file variable must be altered to `/data/onewatt.csv`, `/data/eightwatt.csv`, or `/data/sixteenwatt.csv`.
