# GSAP (prognostics engine) related configurations

# GSAP processes data at a certain rate.
gsap_rate: 0.5              # hz

# Power fault profiles (found in ../profiles) are CSV files whose rows
# may represent any time interval. It is typical for the interval to
# be 1Hz. To synchronize the consumption of these profiles with
# GSAP's processing time of 0.5 Hz, we use every Nth profile line,
# where N = profile interval/gsap_rate. For now, we avoid additional
# user specification and computation by providing the required value
# of N here.

# Similarly, since the inputs used to compute power consumption come
# from the /joint_states topic published at 50Hz, we multiply this by
# GSAP's rate to determine the number of entries used in a moving
# average:
