ow_simulator primarily contains ROS/Gazebo packages related to visual and
physical simulation for OceanWATERS.

ow_lander simulates the lander on Europa, and encapsulates the moveit path planning

The trajectories generated by "roslaunch ow_lander plan_trajectory.launch" are saved in ~/.ros

One can override the default x and y location of the trench center with "trench_x:=<value>" and "trench_y:=<value>" 

To run the trajectories on the simulator, run "roslaunch ow europa.launch". Then, run the the send_trajectories.bash script in ow_lander/scripts
